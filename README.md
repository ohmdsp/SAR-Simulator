# SAR-Simulator
Matlab code for simulating a synthetic aperture collection. This code can be used to understand and generate the simulations in the text Spotlight-Mode Synthetic Aperture Radar: A Signal Processing Approach. 

Edit the config file (config.txt) using the explanations in config_explain.txt. Make sure the paths to each needed .txt file is correct. Then run the macro sar_simulator.m and follow the command prompts. There are many editable parameters in the code. Some of them have been hard coded with the option to uncomment the interactive prompts.
